3. <Number of elements in the list binding Q after executing s3(Q,100)>
<At most 300 characters of clear text on the main idea for the definition of s3.>

4.
<At most 300 characters of clear text on the main idea for the definition of s4.>

5. <Number of elements in the list binding Q after executing s4(Q,500)>
s4(Q,500) uses <number> inferences. */
